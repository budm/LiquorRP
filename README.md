DarkRP forked to Improve game play for the semi-serious crowd, 
Aimed at providing multiple changes and tweaks that will make 
it harder to minge, but also changing the way DarkRP is played
and feels.

The Reason for the removal of guns, was to limit the RDMs and
to set up a reason for fighting, but not over the top fighting
so Gangs of Bootleggers and two Distillers will provide a reason
for small amounts of fighting, and something for cops to still 
pursue other than guns. 

Proposed Changes:
  *Removal of all guns (Should be Complete Commit 1)
  
  *Setting up a British style of Civil Protection. (no guns just stun sticks that will do minor damage)
  
  *Only other weapons being knifes and smoke/stun grenades. (stun grenades will be only for CPs)
  
  *PERP style Character Setup (Set Name & Model on join)
  
  *Inclusion of a illegal & Legal alcohol market
  
  *integration of drugs into the market
  
  *Integration of help into the F4 Menu (began)
  
  *Integration of Inventory into F4 Menu (began)
  
  *Creation of Bartender, Distiller, ABC agents, and bootlegger classes (began)
  
  *Design of Distillation Liquor Licenses for distillers to start
   thier own legal distillery to sell to bartenders (expensive)
  
  *Liquor Licenses for Bartenders to sell beer and Liquor(Cheap)
  
  *Creation of many different labs to distill/brew/produce different things 
  (Much like PERP, it will take time for stuff to brew/grow/distill)
  
  *Redesigned UI (began)
